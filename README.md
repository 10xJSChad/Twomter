<h2>About Twomter</h2>
Twomter is a simple project made with the goal of creating a Twitter clone, but in the style of late-90s/early-2000s message and imageboards.
Unlike Twitter, you can not "re-tweet" posts, like posts, or follow other profiles.

Twomter is made with Flask and MariaDB on the backend, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend.
